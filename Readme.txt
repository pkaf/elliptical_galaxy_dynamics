This project measures the dynamical mass and other useful parameters of some elliptical galaxies. For this we use the observed position and line-of-sight velocities of handful of tracers such as planetary nebulae, globular clusters etc populating the halo of the host galaxies.

In order to compute the mass of the galaxy we first measure the velocity dispersions of the tracers and hence, also the velocity anisotropy. Number density is assumed from a deprojected Sersic profile. Finally, all the observables are substituted in the Jeans equation to predict the mass within some observed radius.
